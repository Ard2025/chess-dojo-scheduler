{ Before the game started, I was pretty confident we would get an advance Caro. I knew I was going to play c5, as that's my main move in rapid and I have pretty good success with it. I will admit that I was fairly intimidated by my opponent's rating (420 points higher than mine), so I went into this game with the goal of a draw. }

I have only faced this a few times and I don't have the best track record against it. I was also basically out of prep now. } { [%clk 1:31:19] } 5... Nh6 { I vaguely recalled this move from an analysis of one of my rapid games. } { [%clk 1:29:16] } (5...

I'm down a pawn but white's pawns on the kingside are weak, so I thought I had good drawing chances. Again, I was playing for a draw when the game started so I preferred to trade queens. } { [%clk 1:25:58] } (8... d4 9. Bf2 (9.

After the game though, I'm quite disappointed I didn't play better in the endgame and make more out of my winning chances.
Overall, I think the main takeaways from this game are: (1) slow down, especially in positions that are either winning or drawn. If you get in time trouble, you can always just take the easy draw. (2) I need to work on my end game play, as I missed a lot of winning chances even after I blundered Bxh5. } { [%clk 0:02:12] } 1/2-1/2

I thought we had basically transposed back into the position from the video, except with the inclusion of Nb6 Bb3, so I played Qe2 after a brief check for any obvious tactics.

I had already been considering an eventual Bc2 in order to trade LSBs and facilitate my attack on the kingside. I wasn't sure if I wanted to play it before or after Ne4 but Na5 decided that for me. Na5 is a mistake because it gives me a tempo to do what I already wanted anyway, and black will have to spend another tempo moving the knight back from the rim. So in effect, this loses 2 tempi. } { [%clk 1:00:25] } (12... Rc8 { This is the move I was expecting during the game, but my opponent told me afterward that he was worried about d5.
